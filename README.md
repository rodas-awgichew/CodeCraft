# CodeCraft HTML

This project provides the foundational HTML structure for CodeCraft, which is an interactive learning environment. The HTML code defines the layout, key user interface elements, and basic navigation for the application.

## Features

- **Semantic Structure:**  
  Uses semantic HTML5 elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`) to ensure accessibility and maintainability.

- **Navigation Bar:**  
  Includes a responsive navigation bar for easy movement between major sections such as Home, Projects, Tutorials, and Contact.

- **Project Showcase:**  
  Displays a grid or list of featured projects with titles, descriptions, and links for more details.

- **Interactive Sections:**  
  Contains sections for user interactions, such as forms for feedback or registration, and placeholders for dynamic content.

- **Call to Action:**  
  Prominent buttons or links encourage users to sign up, start a new project, or explore tutorials.

- **Footer:**  
  Provides links to additional resources, social media, and copyright information.


## Customization

The HTML is designed to be easily extended or themed via CSS and JavaScript. Placeholder elements are provided for integrating additional features such as authentication, dashboards, or user profiles.
